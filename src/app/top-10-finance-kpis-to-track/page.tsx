          "This ratio is crucial for businesses to assess their capacity to meet short-term liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory, which may not be easily converted to cash. The quick ratio provides a stringent measure of a company’s financial health, ensuring that it can handle unexpected expenses or financial downturns effectively.",

This ratio provides insights into how well a company can use its assets that are expected to be converted to cash within a year to cover its liabilities due within the same period. By evaluating the current ratio, businesses can make informed decisions on managing working capital more effectively, ensuring they have enough resources to handle day-to-day operations and unexpected financial demands.",

          "The debt-to-equity ratio is a metric used to assess a company’s capital structure and financial leverage. It is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. This ratio helps businesses, investors, and creditors evaluate a company’s solvency, financial stability, and ability to meet its debt obligations.",
          "A high debt-to-equity ratio shows that a company is financing a significant portion of its operations through debt, which may imply higher financial risk.",

This metric is crucial for businesses to understand how quickly they are depleting their available cash and to plan accordingly.",

It serves as a critical indicator of financial performance, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into how effectively the company is generating earnings on a per-share basis.",
          " A higher EPS shows stronger profitability and can enhance investor confidence, potentially leading to increased demand for the company’s shares in the stock market.",

This ratio is fundamental in assessing how the market values a company’s stock relative to its profitability. By dividing the current market price of a company’s stock by its EPS, investors and analysts can gauge whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced in relation to its earnings.",
          "A higher P/E ratio shows that investors expect higher future growth and are willing to pay a premium for the stock.",
          "A lower P/E ratio shows that the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings, potentially indicating lower growth expectations or concerns about the company’s performance.",

        listParagraph: [
          "The Cash Conversion Cycle is a financial metric that measures how long it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. It reflects the time duration between when a business pays for its raw materials and when it receives cash from selling the final products. A shorter cash conversion cycle shows that a company is more efficient in managing its working capital and converting its resources into cash, which is generally favourable. A longer cash conversion cycle shows inefficiencies in inventory management, slow collections from customers, or delayed payments to suppliers, potentially leading to liquidity challenges.",

It is a crucial metric for startups and early-stage companies, indicating their financial sustainability and ability to stay operational without additional financing. Maintaining a sufficient cash runway is essential for business continuity, allowing companies to weather economic downturns, pursue growth opportunities, and attract investors.",

          "The solvency ratio is a financial metric used to assess a company’s ability to meet its long-term debt obligations. It measures the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by equity versus debt. In essence, the solvency ratio indicates the extent to which a company’s assets are sufficient to cover its liabilities, including both short-term and long-term debt.",
          "A higher solvency ratio shows a greater degree of financial stability and indicates that a company is better equipped to weather financial challenges and honor its debt obligations.",
          "A lower solvency ratio shows higher financial risk, as it implies that a larger portion of the company’s assets is funded by debt rather than equity.",
