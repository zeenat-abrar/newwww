With a unified data platform, inventory levels are updated in real-time across all locations. Suppose a specific product is selling faster in one region. In that case, the system can automatically trigger notifications to transfer stock from a slower-moving location, balancing inventory levels and maximizing sales opportunities. With historical data in hand, predictive models can calculate demand in advance and reduce stockouts and avoid overstocking.",
