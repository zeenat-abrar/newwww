Companies are increasingly turning to data before making decisions, rather than depending solely on intuition or long tiring excel crunching. Companies are better positioned to produce accurate forecasts when Big Data is combined with AI, machine learning, and data mining. The data generated by collecting information from all possible areas provides insight on what worked or didn’t work before, enabling faster and better decisions.",
