Every manufacturer’s roadmap to maximizing OEE efficiency is going to vary based on their business requirements. Improving the OEE may involve making a few changes to the existing framework. On the same note, it can also involve adopting new strategies altogether.",

      "IDA stands for information, decision, and action and is an effective tool for businesses to reach their manufacturing goals.

This becomes extremely critical to not only identifying constraints but also making informed decisions. Collecting data with OEE intelligence capabilities is the first step to identifying manufacturing constraints. Presenting the data via an OEE dashboard measure APQ measurements in real time. Businesses can keep a bird’s eye view of the problems, what caused them, and the time it took in resolving each issue.",
